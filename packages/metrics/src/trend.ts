// Quality over time (#77, step 3). The comparator that replaces cohorts.
//
// Once AI participates in nearly every commit, "AI vs human" has no second
// side left to compare against — `No baseline cohort` is the normal outcome,
// not bad luck. What still answers "is this getting better or worse?" is the
// repo compared with its own past: is rework rising since we raised agent
// autonomy, did persistence degrade after switching models.
//
// Derived from the commit stream in a single run rather than from stored
// snapshots: a team gets a trend the first time they run evidtrail, instead of
// after months of collecting runs. Comparing archived `metrics.json` files
// remains possible on top of this and adds only what history cannot
// reconstruct.
//
// THE TRAP THIS IS BUILT AROUND: a period that ended yesterday has had one
// day to be reworked, while a period from last year has had a year. Compare
// them raw and every report ever generated says quality is collapsing — an
// artifact of the clock, stated as a finding. Two mechanisms prevent it:
//
//   1. Every period is measured through the SAME observation window
//      (`observationDays`, via the age-normalization from #29), so no period
//      gets credit for time the others did not have.
//   2. A period is `mature` only once it ended at least `observationDays`
//      ago — before that, its files have not all had the full window. The
//      most recent periods are always immature; they are reported, marked,
//      and deliberately excluded from every comparison.
